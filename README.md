# Pdf_Booking_Printing
PDF rearrange utility for being capable to print a pdf in a book form. 

(Pd: The file is 'PDF_script.py' the rest are test and similar)


Problem: If you want to print a pdf in order to make a book*, the natural order of the pages in the pdf file make imposible to achieve the correct order in the printed book.

*This mean: two page for sheet, in a doble-siding printing. Each printed page is folded by half and stack with every other folded  page printed. In this way, you can create a manageable book with a confort size and less paper waste.


Solution: This utility rearrange the pages of the pdf file in a way that achieve the correct order in the printed book. After this, you take the output_pdf and configure the printer in "two page for sheet, doble-siding printing". And if your printer shift the page automatically, you have to set "Short edge flip" or something similar. 

I hope that this may will be usefull for you. And that someone ever use it apart from me jajaja.
