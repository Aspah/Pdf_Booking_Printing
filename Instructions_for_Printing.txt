Pdf_Booking_Printing

Page rearranging app, that allow print a PDF in the necessary compagination for set up it in book format
Instructions:



The Problem: 
If you want to print a pdf in order to make a book*, the natural order of the pages in the pdf file make imposible
to achieve the correct order in the printed book.

*This mean: two page for sheet, in a doble-siding printing. Each printed page is folded by half and stack with 
every other folded page printed. In this way, you can create a manageable book with a confort size and less paper waste.

The Solution: 
This utility rearrange the pages of the pdf file in a way that achieve the correct order in the printed book. 
After this, you take the output_pdf and configure the printer in "two page for sheet, doble-siding printing". 
And if your printer shift the page automatically, you have to set "Short edge flip" or something similar.

Also, you can use this utility with any number of PDFs at once!


I hope that this may will be usefull for you. And that someone ever use it apart from me jajaja.
